# Pin the story evidence scaffold, the Strategy Test IDs table, and Check 21's reading of it.
#
# SUBJECT. Five shipped files, one contract:
#   - stories-test-strategy.md, Story-Authoring Pre-Flight Checklist item (c): every story
#     file carries four evidence headings, one of them the `## Strategy Test IDs` table with
#     a closed `Kind` vocabulary; Step 5 item 3 writes one row per lettered strategy case.
#   - gate-validation.md Check 21: the citation set IS that table; a case letter with no row
#     fails; a strategy with no id table is a SKIP that says so, never a PASS.
#   - dev.md `## QA Handoff Evidence`: the full-collection run WITH its counts before the
#     handoff message, the dependency setup that makes that run reproducible from a fresh
#     detached worktree recorded beside it, the four sections filled, every table row resolved.
#   - qa.md `## Handoff Evidence Precondition`: QA rejects before validating when that
#     evidence, the dependency setup included, is absent.
#   - code-reviewer.md Field Verification: the baseline-fixture sweep when a diff changes a
#     handler's result shape.
# No script reads any of this; the executing agents read the prose, so the prose is the
# mechanism and this fixture pins it on the section that carries it.
#
# WHY THE DEV AND QA ARMS SHADOW BEFORE THEY READ. The reference consumer shadows
# `team-roles/dev.md#Workflow Per Task` and `team-roles/qa.md#Validation Checklist` with
# override bodies of its own, so text placed in either section never reaches that consumer's
# dev or QA. Each arm therefore replaces those two sections with a stub first, the way the
# loader does, and only then looks. The mutants that MOVE the text into a shadowed section
# still leave it in the file, which a whole-file grep would accept; these arms must not.
#
# Exit 0 iff every arm holds; 1 on a finding; 2 (FIXTURE BROKEN) when a subject file cannot
# be located. An absent subject is never green.

# MARKER_A. A closer that probes `base` instead of `theirs` sees neither marker and calls
# both STILL-LIVE — so Entry B's CLOSE-CANDIDATE assertion below goes red. That is the
# mutation proof baked into the pair: the fixture cannot pass a closer that ignores theirs.

# THE THIRD DIFFERENTIAL — a declared manual entry vs a malformed one. Both used to land on

# THE FOURTH DIFFERENTIAL — path namespace. G carries Entry B's claim verbatim but filed in
# the consumer install layout. Before the basename fallback it reported NEEDS-REVIEW: the
# substring was never compared, so the closer said nothing about a claim upstream had already
# absorbed. G and B must agree; that they can disagree at all is the defect.

# THE FIFTH DIFFERENTIAL — a close nothing upstream produced. J and K classify CLOSE-CANDIDATE
# on the theirs-side test alone, but neither predicate's STILL-LIVE side was ever reachable:
# J's substring is absent at base AND theirs, K's is present at both. A closer that tests only
# theirs emits a confident close for a claim no upstream change touched, and a drain acts on
# it. Six entries on the reference consumer had exactly this shape, every one a live defect.

row_is "Entry K" NEEDS-REVIEW    "theirs_lacks on a substring present at base too -> vacuous, not absorbed"

# THE SIXTH DIFFERENTIAL — more than one substring in a directive. Joined into a single
# literal (quotes included) the pattern matches nothing, so BOTH L and M report "still
# lacks" and only L is right. M is the damage: theirs carries both markers, and the entry
# would sit open forever against an upstream that had already absorbed it. Matching each
# substring separately is what makes the pair disagree, which is what makes the test real.
row_is "Entry L" STILL-LIVE      "two substrings, neither at theirs -> genuinely still live"

# THE SECOND DIFFERENTIAL — entry SHAPE. These three carry the same directives as B/C/D but
# in the `## SECTION-ID — title` shape instead of a `- **bullet**`. A parser that treats every
# heading as a pure terminator clears the label, so the directive is parsed and then dropped:
# no row, exit 0, indistinguishable from "nothing to close". Measured on the reference
# consumer, where every entry filed after 2026-07-20 used this shape and the one entry that
# had adopted the verify: convention at all was invisible while upstream had already fixed it.

#
# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH. install.sh and reconcile/preclassify.sh's
# map_consumer() are two writers of the same consumer files, and they must agree on the
# destination or the consumer gets two copies at two paths — and the one the pull keeps
# fresh is not the one anything reads. I8 asserts that agreement. It has now been wrong
# three times, and the third is why this fixture exists:
#
#   fixtures     -> .claude/fixtures/     (dead; H1 reads tests/fixtures/)
#   ci-templates -> .claude/ci-templates/ (dead; workflows run from .github/workflows/)
#   git-hooks    -> .claude/git-hooks/    (dead; install.sh writes .githooks/)
#
# The first two were found and I8 gained a row for each. git-hooks was NOT found, and the
# reason is the whole lesson: I8's site list was HAND-MAINTAINED, so the check did not
# fail on core/git-hooks/ — it simply had no row for it, and a check that cannot fire
# reads exactly like a check that passed. v0.53.0's pre-push gate — shipped as the
# replacement for the deleted CI workflow — therefore reached the reference consumer at a
# path no runner, no `core.hooksPath`, and no script reads. That consumer had Actions
# disabled, so its ONLY automated gate could not fire, and nothing said so for two minors.
#
# So the assertions below are about the CHECK, not about today's table. A table with the
# right rows in it today proves nothing; what must hold is that a missing row, a wrong
# mapping, or a destination the installer never writes each FAILS. Assertion 0 exists
# because every negative assertion here would score a false pass against a validator that
# is simply broken and erroring for unrelated reasons.

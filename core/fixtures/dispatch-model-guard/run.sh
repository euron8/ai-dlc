# Drives ai-dlc-dispatch-guard.sh against a seeded layered consumer.
#
# v0.79.x: the guard SETS the model instead of DENYING a wrong/absent one. On the correcting path
# it returns `permissionDecision: "allow"` with `updatedInput.model` = the role's pinned tier; on an
# already-correct or fail-open dispatch it exits 0 with NO output. So the assertions check the
# INJECTED tier, not a deny verdict.
#
# THE TEETH, restated for the flip. The motivating failure was a no-param spawn on a resumed session
# running on an undetermined model. The correcting cases below (absent param, wrong tier) must now
# emit `updatedInput.model` = the pin. If the guard silently reverted to allow-all, every correcting
# assertion reads empty and FAILS — the check cannot pass vacuously. The already-correct and
# fail-open cases must emit NOTHING (no forced approval, no injection), or the guard would be
# rewriting inputs it has no pin for, or force-approving dispatches another hook may need to deny.

# Drives the pre-push suite's per-fixture READ-SET SKIP.
#
# WHAT IS BEING PROVEN, and why each arm has to exist. The skip decides which fixtures do not
# run. Its failure mode is not a slow suite -- it is a SILENTLY SHORT one: a fixture that never
# ran reports nothing and the summary still says green. So every arm below asserts a POSITIVE
# outcome (this exact set was selected) rather than the absence of an old failure, and the
# mutants each declare the exact arms they must move.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS FIXTURE EXISTS BECAUSE OF. During development the selection injected each
# changed path's synthesised PARENT DIRECTORY into the `.changed` set, which then failed the
# "changed path no fixture reads" test -- so the skip fell back to the full suite in EVERY
# scenario while announcing it in wording that read like caution. It was inert, green, and
# indistinguishable from a working skip by any test asserting "nothing regressed". Arm 2 is
# the one that catches it, and it catches it only because it asserts a subset was selected.

# A consumer that tunes AI_DLC_FIXTURE_JOBS or AI_DLC_FIXTURE_NO_SKIP in settings.json would
# otherwise have that value decide these arms, and the fixture would be testing the CONFIG

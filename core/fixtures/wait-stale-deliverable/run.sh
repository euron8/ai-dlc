# wait-stale-deliverable — the bounded join must not accept a file that predates
# it, and must still arm the yield while it waits.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS ADDRESSES. `wait-for-deliverable.sh` tested delivery with
# `[ -s "$t" ]`. A deliverable path reused across sprints therefore reported
# DELIVERED in under a second against the PREVIOUS sprint's file. Observed live: a
# bug-investigation join landed on a 41KB analysis committed three sprints earlier
# and the lead caught it only by reading a date line in the body. A join that
# always succeeds reads exactly like a join that worked — nothing downstream ever
# re-examines it, which is why this is a silent wrong answer and not a stall.
#
# THE SECOND-ORDER FAILURE. The instant-DELIVERED path returned before the script
# ever reached its sleep, so `.beat-inflight` was never written. That marker is the
# ONLY thing Stop-hook Check 2b accepts as permission to end a turn mid-join, so
# the lead could not yield, hand-rolled an mtime loop that writes no marker either,
# and fell back to foreground polling — the exact cost this script exists to
# eliminate. Hence `stale-marker`: fixing the predicate must also restore the yield.
#
# THE TRAP. `--since` cannot be the authority. A lead writes `dispatched-at`
# ROUNDED (observed: 23:30:00Z for a 23:29:50 dispatch — ten seconds into the
# FUTURE), and a future threshold is absorbing: the teammate's file is never
# rewritten, so every later beat re-reads the same mtime and the join walks to a
# non-delivery on a complete artifact. `since-clamp` is that scenario; it passes
# only because the subject clamps --since to `now`.

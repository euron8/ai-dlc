# THE DIFFERENTIAL IS THE WHOLE MECHANISM. `gate-defer` and `gate-broken` both exit non-zero on the
# incoming side. A gate reading the incoming exit code alone calls them the same thing — and calling
# a pre-existing failure a "defer" strands the machinery slice for a reason unrelated to the pull.
# Only comparing against the consumer's CURRENT copy separates a new finding from an old one, and
# the mutation below removes exactly that comparison.

# h2-attest-scripts-dir — validate-h2-attestation.sh --attest must DRIVE its fixture in
# a real consumer layout, where the core validators live at scripts/ai-dlc/ and bare
# scripts/ holds only consumer-authored tooling.
#
# Usage: run.sh
# Exit:  0 = every assertion holds, 1 = the check regressed, 2 = fixture broken.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH.
#
# v0.138.0 and every release before it computed the validator directory here:
#
#   SCRIPTS_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR/scripts"
#   [ -f "$SCRIPTS_DIR/validate-provenance-block.sh" ] || SCRIPTS_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR/core/scripts"
#   ...
#   bash "$RUN" --scripts "$SCRIPTS_DIR"
#
# Both faults matter, and the second is what made it fatal. The pair predates the
# v0.126.0 relocation, so it never names scripts/ai-dlc/ — and the fallback is assigned
# with NO existence test, so "not found" is indistinguishable from "found at
# core/scripts". That unchecked guess was then ASSERTED to the fixture runner as an
# explicit --scripts override, overriding check-17-bypass/run.sh's own candidate list,
# which has included scripts/ai-dlc/ since v0.126.0 and was right all along.
#
# The result in a consumer: --attest died on
#
#   FAIL: cannot locate validate-provenance-block.sh (pass --scripts DIR)
#
# while the very same fixture, run by hand with no --scripts, self-located and passed
# the full matrix. H2 could not attest, so the sprint's gate log could carry no
# H2_ATTESTED line and the harness self-test had no mechanical result at all.
#
# WHY THIS IS A FIXTURE OF ITS OWN, AND NOT A SECTION IN validator-path-resolution.
#
# That fixture already enumerates every core/scripts/*.sh, including this one, and is the
# obvious home. It cannot host this proof. To compare layouts it installs all ~26
# validators into BOTH scripts/ and scripts/ai-dlc/ — and in that tree the BROKEN line
# finds $WORK/scripts/validate-provenance-block.sh and succeeds. The assertion would be
# green against the exact bug it was written for.
#
# The proof needs a tree where bare scripts/ is what a real consumer's is: present,
# populated, and holding no core validator. That is the whole design of this fixture,
# and it is why the decoy below is not decoration.
#
# (validator-path-resolution never reaches this code by another route either: its default
# bare invocation exits at the usage line, the blind spot its own comments name.)

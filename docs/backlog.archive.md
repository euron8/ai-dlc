## BL-009

**LANDED (v0.373.0, verified 953e39e).** Both halves the receipt requires are present:
`**Evidence required:**` on the severity rule, and a query-shape step in the procedure
directing the reviewer at "the fields the change SENDS, not only the ones it reads". Fixed at
`941021d`, guarded at `953e39e`, both inside v0.373.0. **The procedure half is UNGUARDED and
that was a measurement, not an oversight** — an arm keyed on the token `quer` plus a closed
list of send verbs fired on 3 of 5 legitimate rewordings that fully preserved the instruction,
leaving a false-positive set that is an open class of legitimate English. The guard's own
header says so at `core/fixtures/gate-verdict-grep-shape/run.sh`, so its green line is not to
be read as covering that half.

**A producer-side severity rule whose triggering condition no procedure tells the reviewer to
look for.** `core/team-roles/code-reviewer.md:223-228` classifies *Missing Pre-Deploy Field
Verification* as Important: "Any change that adds a new field to an API query without logged
verification against the deployed schema". That condition is PRODUCER-side — a change to the query
being sent.

The file's only field-verification procedure is at `:116-129`, headed
`## Field Verification (API-Consuming Stories)`, and its step 1 directs the reviewer at "response
field access patterns" — READ patterns only. Nothing in `core/` points a reviewer at query shape:
`grep -rniE 'query-shape|query shape|changes that add fields' core/` returns rc=1 across the whole
tree, against a control of `response field access patterns` hitting `:121`. **The rule cannot fire,
because the observation that would trigger it is one nobody is instructed to make.**

Gate Check 10 does not cover it. `core/skills/ai-dlc/steps/gate-validation.md:589` opens "Skip if no
stories modify API queries or schema definitions" — it PRESUMES someone already knows a query
changed, which is exactly what the missing procedure step would produce, and it is a different
actor, artifact and time.

Within the contiguous severity run at `:187-228` it is also the only rule carrying no
`**Evidence required:**` clause. **The TSV evidence overstated that scope and it is narrowed here:**
`## Mandatory Severity Classifications` starts at `:171` with 19 `###` subsections and the file has
4 `Evidence required` sites total, so 15 lack one. The claim holds over `:187-228`, not the section.

Anchored on both halves a fix cannot omit — the file's own `Evidence required:` convention inside
the rule, and the query side inside the procedure. A partial fix does not close it.

Discharges the consumer bullet at pinned ledger line 273
(`extensions/roles/code-reviewer-push.md`, which carries no `PC-` id). That row is `CLOSE-NARROWED`
and its close is GATED on this entry.

## BL-011

**LANDED (v0.373.0, verified cb94a43).** The three seeded legends are byte-identical at 2102
bytes each, `PAUSE_SKIPPED` is documented, `BACKOFF` carries one stated cause, and the
retro-guidance block is in all three. Fixed at `941021d`, guarded at `cb94a43`, both inside
v0.373.0. The guard is Assertion 8 in `core/fixtures/pause-hook-origin/run.sh` with a mutation
battery at Assertion 9 — it refuses to compare until each hook has exactly ONE legend opener
and each extraction is non-empty, so three empty strings cannot compare equal and close the
entry on a dead instrument. That is the arm the entry's own anti-vacuity clause asked for, and
it replaces the per-hook assertion that stayed green through the whole life of the divergence.

**Three hooks seed the flow log's legend, first writer wins, and the three disagree.**
`_bmad-output/pipeline-continuation-log.md` is opened by whichever of three hooks fires first, each
seeding a legend into an absent-or-empty file and returning otherwise:
`core/hooks/ai-dlc-continue.sh:103`, `core/hooks/ai-dlc-acknowledge.sh:489`, and
`core/hooks/ai-dlc-pause.sh:248-251`. Three heredoc bodies, measured at HEAD: 1435 / 1148 / 1835
bytes. Three ways the same sprint's log can be documented, selected by hook firing order.

- **`BACKOFF` has two definitions.** `pause.sh:270` says "stop_hook_active was true; loop prevention
  engaged"; `continue.sh:118` and `acknowledge.sh:506` say "rapid-fire stop attempts detected; stall
  confirmed". Two different causes for one event name.
- **`PAUSE_SKIPPED` is documented in one legend of three** (`pause.sh:261`), so a log seeded by
  either sibling and then written by `pause.sh:299` carries events its own legend never names.
- **`acknowledge.sh` omits the retro-guidance block entirely**, going `:506` to `:509` while
  `continue.sh:122-128` and `pause.sh:274-281` carry the interpretation bullets.

`retro.md` §4b reads this log for per-event counts, so the legend is the reader's only statement of
what a count means.

`core/fixtures/pause-hook-origin/run.sh:100-106` already asserts the legend documents
`PAUSE_SKIPPED` — but it reads `pause.sh` ONLY. It is a per-hook assertion against a cross-hook
defect, so it stays green while the divergence stands, and it is why exactly one of the three
legends carries that entry.

Anchored on byte-identity of the three heredoc bodies, which no prose can satisfy. The non-emptiness
guard is the anti-vacuity arm: if extraction ever breaks, three empty strings compare equal and the
entry would close on a broken instrument.

Discharges the surviving sub-claim of `PC-S295-FLOWLOG-HEADER-LEGEND-IS-GREPPABLE-AS-DATA` (pinned
line 387), whose own close annotation names this defect as "a separate defect, worth filing" and
which was NEVER filed — 0 hits in `docs/backlog.md` and `docs/backlog.archive.md` against a control
of `verify:` hitting `docs/backlog.md:13`. A clean close of that entry deletes the sole written
record of a live defect, so the close is GATED on this entry.

## BL-012

**LANDED (v0.374.0, verified 21df49b).** The `**Style:**` block now carries the permitted form
— `Rule <n>`, `Rule <n>(<letter>)`, `Step <n>`, and `I23` for a mechanism — fixed at `941021d`
inside v0.373.0. **The close is at v0.374.0 and not v0.373.0, because the fix shipped with its
guard OWED**: `941021d`'s own body closes with "None of the three entries may be annotated
LANDED until that work is done", and BL-012's guard was the one of the three that never
arrived. It is `IDENTIFIER_GRANT`, Class 1c of `core/scripts/audit-rule-files.sh`, probed both
directions by assertions 12m–12p of `core/fixtures/retro-audit-scans/run.sh`.

The guard is anchored on the grant's TEMPLATE for the reason this entry already measured: the
grant's closing clause is itself a prohibition, so a Style block holding that clause alone is
prohibitions-only, IS the defect, and still contains the word `identifier`. That input is
assertion 12m, and it is the one an `identifier` anchor scores CLEAN.

`PC-S295-RETRO-RULE18-STABLE-IDENTIFIER-TAGS` (pinned line 610) is the consumer entry this
discharges, and its gate is unchanged by this close: **close 610 ONLY as part of an APPLIED
merge with pinned line 177**, which is `verify: manual` and whose body says no mechanical
anchor was derivable. This receipt remains the only mechanical anchor either entry has.

**The rule-authoring style guide forbids every way a rule could carry a citable identifier, and
permits none.** `core/skills/ai-dlc/rule-authoring.md` is the style guide that `SKILL.md` Rule 18
(`:615`) and `retro.md` Step 4's rule-file audit both bind to. Its `**Style:**` block prohibits "No
sprint or story references" at `:15` and "No parenthetical origin notes after a directive" at `:17`,
and grants no permitted form for a stable identifier a later rule can cite:
`grep -niE 'carve-out|carve out|exception|except when|stable identifier|identifier'` over the file
returns rc=1, against a control of `No sprint or story references` hitting `:15`. `SKILL.md`'s only
`carve-out` hit is `:347`, an unrelated live-security-state grant.

So `retro.md` Step 4 has a prohibition it can enforce against any tag a rule carries, and no form it
can point the author at instead. Rules in this skill are already cited by identifier throughout —
"Rule 18", "Rule 27", "Rule 25(c)", the `I79` markers at `SKILL.md:612` and `:631` — a shape the
guide governing them never authorizes.

**This is a missing-permitted-form defect, NOT a live contradiction, and the TSV evidence implied
otherwise.** `grep -rnE '\bS[0-9]{3}\b|\bLR-S[0-9]+|Sprint [0-9]{3}'` over `rule-authoring.md` and
`SKILL.md` returns rc=1, against a control of the same regex over `core/skills/ai-dlc/steps/`
returning 4 hits. Neither rule file currently violates its own prohibition.

Anchored on the `**Style:**` block, not the whole file. A looser anchor false-closes today:
`grep -nwE 'id'` already matches `:26` ("shadows it by id"), and a mention outside the Style block is
not a permitted form an author can follow.

**Anchored on the grant's TEMPLATE, not on the word "identifier", and that narrowing is the
receipt.** The grant is one multi-line bullet whose closing clause is itself a prohibition — "An
identifier is a name and MUST NOT encode a sprint, story, version, or date" — so a Style block
holding that clause ALONE is prohibitions-only, is exactly the defect this entry states, and
contains the word "identifier". Measured on a `cmp -s`-guarded copy: with the grant clause deleted
and that trailing prohibition retained, an `identifier` anchor returns **rc=0 CLOSE-CANDIDATE** on
the defect itself; only total deletion of the bullet returns rc=1. A permitted form cannot be
written without EXHIBITING the form, so the anchor is the backticked placeholder template
(`` `Rule <n>` ``, `` `Step <n>` ``), which no prohibition in the block carries. False-positive set
measured EMPTY over five legitimate rewordings of the same block — bullets reordered, grant prose
rewritten, grant widened with a further kind, placeholder letter changed, bullet unwrapped to one
line — all rc=0, against the two offenders above at rc=1 in the same invocation.

Discharges the mechanical anchor of `PC-S295-RETRO-RULE18-STABLE-IDENTIFIER-TAGS` (pinned line 610).
**This gate is load-bearing in a way the others are not.** That entry's `merge:` field routes it into
the pinned line 177 entry, which is `verify: manual` and whose body says "No mechanical anchor was
derivable" — so this receipt is the only mechanical anchor either entry has, and line 177 carries a
RECIPROCAL duplicate declaration naming 610 as the survivor. An adjudicator reading either alone has
textual grounds to close it into the other, which would delete the anchor permanently. **Close 610
ONLY as part of an APPLIED merge.**
